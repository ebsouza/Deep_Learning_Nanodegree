This is a list of Udacity Projects that I've been worked in Deep Learning Nanodegree Fundamentals for about 5 months. 


**Project 1**

In this project, I got to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset. This project gave me a better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as Tensorflow.


**Project 2**

The goal of this project was classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset was need to be preprocessed, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. It was necessary to normalize the images, one-hot encode the labels, build a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connect layer to got predictions on the sample images.


**Project 3**

In this project I got an experience into the realm of neural network machine translation. I trained a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French.

**Project 4**

This project has a purpose to gerenate  Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. A Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons was used to Neural Network generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.

**Project 5**

A Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) can generate new images of faces.
